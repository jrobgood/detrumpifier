# Mobile Usage Instructions

## Quick Option: Bookmarklet (Works on Most Mobile Browsers)

### Setup Instructions:

#### iPhone/iPad (Safari):
1. Copy the entire code from `bookmarklet.min.js`
2. Add this page to bookmarks (tap Share → Add Bookmark)
3. Edit the bookmark:
   - Change name to "Detrumpifier"
   - Replace the URL with the copied javascript code
4. Save the bookmark

#### Android (Chrome):
1. Bookmark any page
2. Go to Chrome menu → Bookmarks
3. Long-press the bookmark and select "Edit"
4. Change name to "Detrumpifier"
5. Replace URL with the code from `bookmarklet.min.js`

### Usage:
1. Visit Google News
2. Tap the bookmarklet from your bookmarks
3. Trump articles will be hidden
4. Blue notification appears showing filter count

## Better Option: Kiwi Browser (Android Only)

Kiwi Browser supports Chrome extensions directly!

1. Install [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) from Play Store
2. In Kiwi, go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Load the extension folder directly

## For Power Users: Firefox Mobile (Android)

1. Install Firefox for Android
2. We'll need to submit to Mozilla Add-ons
3. Or use Firefox Nightly with custom add-on collections

## iOS Alternative: Userscripts App

1. Install [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887) from App Store
2. Set up the extension in Safari
3. Add the filtering script

## Note
The bookmarklet version doesn't persist between page loads - you'll need to tap it each time you visit Google News. The browser extension options (Kiwi, Firefox) work automatically like the desktop version.
