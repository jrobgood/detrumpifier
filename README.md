## Installation

INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK:  it's all the way open source, so you can see I am doing nothing sinister here, but I also take no responsibility for unintended consequences.  This extension is designed for users who are willing to turn on Chrome's developer mode.  

### Installation from GitHub

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**: Begin by obtaining the extension's source code. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file of the repository directly from GitHub and extract it to a convenient location on your computer.
2.  **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome**: Open your Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`. In the top right corner of the extensions page, toggle the **"Developer mode"** switch to the `On` position.
3.  **Load the Unpacked Extension**: With Developer mode enabled, a new button labeled **"Load unpacked"** will appear on the top left of the extensions page. Click this button.
4.  **Select the Extension Folder**: A file dialog will open. Navigate to and select the `chrome_extension_trump_filter` folder that you cloned or extracted in Step 1. **Do not select the ZIP file itself, but the folder containing `manifest.json` and other extension files.**
5.  **Verify Installation**: The "Trump Filter for Google News" extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions. You may want to click the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar and then the pin icon next to the "Trump Filter" to make its icon visible for easy access.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension operates only on Google News pages (`news.google.com`) (for now).  Simply navigate to [Google News](https://news.google.com ). The extension is designed to automatically detect and hide articles that contain references to Donald Trump as the page loads. This provides a cleaner news feed without requiring any manual intervention.

### Manual Controls (via Extension Popup)

For more control, you can interact with the extension's popup:

1.  **Click the Extension Icon**: Click on the icon in your Chrome toolbar (the blue filter icon).
2.  **Filter Current Page**: If you arrive at a Google News page and notice articles that weren't filtered, or if content loads dynamically, you can click the **"Filter Current Page"** button within the popup to re-apply the filtering logic to the currently visible articles.
3.  **Open Filtered View**: To see a curated list of articles that passed the filter, click the **"Open Filtered View"** button. This will open a new tab displaying only the articles deemed free of Trump references, presented in a clean, minimalist layout.
4.  **Monitor Statistics**: The popup also provides real-time statistics, showing you how many articles were filtered out versus the total number of articles detected on the page, giving you immediate feedback on the extension's activity.


VERY INTERESTED to see what people think about this and what enhancements they might want, don't be shy!

Disclaimer:  This extension is for personal use and educational purposes. It modifies the display of web content locally and does not affect the original Google News service.  No content ever leaves your computer and goes anywhere sinister.  Honestly, the whole thing is really a goof, but once I built it I realized it really did calm down my news reading day.  Make what you will of that....
